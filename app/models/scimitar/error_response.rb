    # Originally Scimitar used attribute "detail" for exception text; it was
    # only for JSON responses at the time, but in hindsight was a bad choice.
    # It should have been "message" given inheritance from StandardError, which
    # then works properly with e.g. error reporting services.
    #
    # The "detail" attribute is still present, for backwards compatibility with
    # any client code that might be using this class.
